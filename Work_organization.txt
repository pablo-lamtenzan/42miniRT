My miniRT :

1) Parse input file format
2) Parse input file values
3) Init image
4) Create pthreads
5) Calc image (engine)
6) Free all

TO DO :
//- Parse well
//- Collision function
//- Object creation functions
//- Change color by color precision
//- Copy struct function
//- Export bmp
//- Function that init ray->dir
//- End vec3 lib
//- Normal object functions (cyl to do)
//- Hooks
//- Types in parse
//- parse bonus
//- set good keys
//- Link all

//- Rotation - Translation composed obj
for cyl -> put a pointer to the 2 discks for have acces and rotate/translate
for others -> to think

//- init objs
//- SEE IN LOAD IMAGE (start_multiphreading()) WTF IS USED THE INDEX FOR
//- obj in rt file separeted by blank or just space ?
//- minmax use 2nd param must be aa
//- use is digit in all numb parse
//- check better parse of normal distruption
//- filename for bmp
//- free all (alreaddy did ? about splitmulticharset)
//- obj dist to see if if is ok in all files
//- when i ll test or before check rotation vec fct
//- check leaks in my splitmulticharset
//- create some func that check ints or doubles por parse
//- check all collision functions
//- check all normal functions
//- do map pyramid and map cube and map cyl
//- where i use interdisck ? + check if the plane and cy struct are compatible to be casted in pl and in cy
//- set errors
//- put cool print stuff like "starting ray tracing engine"
//- finish effects
//- check when use 1 pthreads
//- securize all nmap
//- include strlcpy, strlen, strjoin (ft)
//- compile
//- correct errors
- norme
//- optim code
- try to break it
- END + correct

Notes:

Composed obj need to have a create fct (ex: parse a cyl have to add 2 discks)
For that:
//- create struct disc (new obj with collison and normal fct) and calc the 2 pos and inherit the dir when a cyl is parsed
//- pyramid : create a sq, then 4 tr
//- cube : just 6 square

BONUS:
//- Mapping
//- Bonus Collisions
//- Bonus Normals
//- Apply effect
//- Apply filter
//- Damier
//- Rainbow
//- mirror
//- Link all
//- link filters
//- cone normal

//13/05 -> Bonus
//14/05 -> Hooks
//15/05 -> parse
//16/05 -> All the rest (have to work)

Debug:
- when i minimize the image is del
- can t read last line while parsing
- error gestion in parse bonus nb of arg 
- rainbow is ok but so linear lines
- damier bug too (size)
- pyramid base seems smaller
- parse line is too long doesnt ret false
- color of squares and tri in test.rt
