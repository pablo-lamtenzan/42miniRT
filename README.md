### Specifications
This program works in MacOS and Linux, however the graphic lib (minilibX) doesn't work in all the linux architectures. I hardly recommend to run it into Ubunti/Xubuntu OS. It doesn't work on Manjaro arch. If you wan't to run this program in a Darwin arch (MacOs) you need to use version of the graph lib for MacOS (avalaible in minilibX_MacOS dir) and change the value of the variable "LIBX" in the Makefile to minilibX_MacOS.
### Run
For run the program you need to clone this git repository.
`git clone https://github/pablo-lamtenzan/42miniRT
